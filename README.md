# Building the intuition

1. Creata a function for random time.
2. Create a function for getting a random Hole take care of the repeated element
3. function peep for the moles to showup and disappear
4. take time from the randomtime function and hole from the random hole function.
5. setTime out to remove the class.
6. call peep if the runTime is not up else return.
7. create a start game function set the scoreboard and timeup false & call peep.
8. set timeup  = true after a set time out
9. Create a function bonk when clicked on the moles register it and add it to the scoreboard using isTrusted variable.
